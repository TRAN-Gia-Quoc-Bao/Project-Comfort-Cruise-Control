# Project: Comfort-oriented vehicle cruise and semi-active suspension control
My work during the research project "Comfort-oriented Adaptive Cruise Control of an Autonomous Vehicle" done at GIPSA-lab (joint research unit of the French CNRS and Universit√© Grenoble Alpes), January-June 2020, where we considered only cruise control (see details and explanations in the report). Then we extended this into an integrated cruise + semi-active suspension control framework.

I added the codes for cruise control. Codes for semi-active suspension control will come soon.

Contents:
1. Cruise control strategies: Some cruise control approaches I tried during the project.
2. Robustness analysis: To analyze the change in performance of three different controllers w.r.t the change in system parameters.
3. Comfort-oriented cruise control: The final autonomous vehicle cruise control strategy so as to guarantee driving comfort.
