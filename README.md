# Project: Comfort-oriented vehicle cruise and semi-active suspension control
My work during the research project "Comfort-oriented Adaptive Cruise Control of an Autonomous Vehicle" done at GIPSA-lab, where we considered only cruise control (see the report). Then we extended this into an integrated cruise + semi-active suspension framework.
